# gogs-themes
> A attempt to make my self-hosted gogs ***dark*** and ***responsive***

This is very hacky, we need to overide 3 CSS libraries ðŸ˜­. But is does the job, at least on my machine ðŸ˜†. 

Not all page will be *fully* responsive, but main public pages look more frendly. 
Not all pages have been treated. At this time, maybe missing things, mostly on admin pages.

Small bonus, you can choose the accent color among the following:
yellow, red, blue, green magenta.

## Usage

You need to the follow the instructions [here](https://gogs.io/docs/features/custom_template).

-   First place the `.css` file(s) under the public directory (`custom/public/css/`). 

-   Then link the desired `.css` in your custom template:

    Edit the file `custom/templates/inject/head.tmpl` and add a link to desired stylesheet: 

    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/kristuff.gogs.dark.min.css">
    ```

    Or

    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/kristuff.gogs.dark-accent-blue.min.css">
    ```

- You need to restart **gogs** to apply changes to template. Then, you don't need to restart to apply changes in `.css`.
